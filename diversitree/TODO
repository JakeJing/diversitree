For the root treatments with stationary distributions for functions
that modify parameter vectors (currently only classe) be careful that
the stationary distribution is correct.  This is not the case right
now for classe.

ROOT.EQUI check is not being done for t/td/split models as the
rootfunc hides it.  Need to address this.

bd.split is really ugly.

The ODE solvers should use info when building.

The entire history bit (as with most of the plotting) is a bit of a
gong show.

Check and export HMC sampler

Rename profiles-plot file to plot-profiles.

There is some ugliness around name.ode being set/reset all over the
place.  Perhaps make.*t() should alter it, but *.td() and *.split()
leave it alone.
